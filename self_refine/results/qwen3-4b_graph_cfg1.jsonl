The user wants the shortest path from node 0 to node 4 in a directed graph. They've provided all the edges with their weights. The previous solution was [0,1,2,4] with a weight of 134. But the feedback says to check if that's correct.\n\nFirst, I need to verify if the path 0\u21921\u21922\u21924 is indeed the shortest. Let's calculate the weight again. 0\u21921 is 56, 1\u21922 is 27, 2\u21924 is 51. Adding those up: 56 + 27 = 83, then 83 + 51 = 134. That seems right.\n\nBut wait, is there a shorter path? Let's check other possibilities. For example, 0\u21924 directly has a weight of 173, which is higher than 134. What about 0\u21921\u21924? That would be 56 + 66 = 122. Oh, that's lower than 134. Wait, that's a better path. Why wasn't that considered before?\n\nHold on, the previous answer was wrong. The correct shortest path should be 0\u21921\u21924 with a total weight of 56 + 66 = 122. But why did the previous solution say 134? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial calculation.

The user wants the shortest path from node 0 to node 4 in a directed graph. They've provided all the edges with their weights. The previous solution was [0,1,2,4] with a weight of 134. But the feedback says to check if that's correct.\n\nFirst, I need to verify if the path 0\u21921\u21922\u21924 is indeed the shortest. Let's calculate the weight again. 0\u21921 is 56, 1\u21922 is 27, 2\u21924 is 51. Adding those up: 56 + 27 = 83, then 83 + 51 = 134. That seems right.\n\nBut wait, is there a shorter path? Let's check other possibilities. For example, 0\u21924 directly has a weight of 173, which is higher than 134. What about 0\u21921\u21924? That would be 56 + 66 = 122. Oh, that's lower than 134. Wait, that's a better path. Why wasn't that considered before?\n\nHold on, the previous answer was wrong. The correct shortest path should be 0\u21921\u21924 with a total weight of 56 + 66 = 122. But why did the previous solution say 134? Maybe there was a mistake in the initial calculation. The user's feedback indicates that the previous answer was incorrect, so the correct path is 0\u21921\u21924.\n\nSo the correct JSON should have the path", "parsed": null, "correct": false}}
